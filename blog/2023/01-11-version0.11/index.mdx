We'll continute to improve this system according to your feedback.

## Modules have been overhauled and renamed to widgets

Widgets are now much snappier and have been completely recoded.
This fixes some of the bugs a few users have previously experienced and improves overall customization.

## Fancy icon picker for speeding up your creation process

We've also added a new fancy icon picker, you can use to get access to any icons much faster.
We will add more icon sources in the future, as we made this icon picker very modular, and we plan to make local icons accessible via this picker very soon.
