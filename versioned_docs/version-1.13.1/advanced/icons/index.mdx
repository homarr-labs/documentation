## Icon picker
Icons in Homarr are automatically requested from multiple sources:
  - [Walkxcode Dashboard icons](https://github.com/walkxcode/dashboard-icons)
  - [selfh.st icons](https://github.com/selfhst/icons)
  - [Simple icons](https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons)
  - [Tabler icons](https://tabler-icons.io/)
  - [Papirus icons](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme)
  - [Homelab Svg assets](https://github.com/loganmarchione/homelab-svg-assets)
  - **Local icons**: automatically fetched from the [medias feature](/docs/management/media/)

Using these icon sources, Homarr provides a total collection over over 11'000 icons at your fingertips.
The icon picker is a fast searcher that helps you to find your desired icon simply by entering search term.

Icons, that are high quality and printable ([SVG](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics)) are marked with a red badge "SVG" at the top right.

### Using external icons
If you do not wish to upload an icon in Homarr but you also didn't find the icon you're looking for, you can simply enter a URL that points to an icon.
It is important that the URL directly points to the file without any advertisements or elements around it.
