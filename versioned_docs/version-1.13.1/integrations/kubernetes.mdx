Homarr provides a user-friendly Kubernetes dashboard that offers an overview of your clusterâ€™s resources in a clear and structured interface. It allows users to view key Kubernetes objects, including `Pods`, `Services`, `Ingresses`, `Nodes`, `ConfigMaps`, `Secrets`, `Namespaces`, and `Volumes`, as well as basic metrics when the Kubernetes Metrics Server is enabled.

:::warning[Read only]
This integration is read-only, meaning Homarr does not modify or manage cluster resources but serves as an informational tool to enhance visibility into your Kubernetes environment.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying Homarr in Kubernetes, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- Kubernetes (Version >= 1.24.0)
- Metrics Server ([Install from here](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server))
- RBAC Enabled (Required for Homarr Helm chart)

## Configuring RBAC in Helm Chart

To enable RBAC for Homarr, configure the Helm chart values file as follows:

```yaml
rbac:
  enabled: true
```

:::tip[What Does rbac.enabled Do?]
Enabling RBAC in the Helm chart creates the necessary Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) resources to allow Homarr to view various Kubernetes objects. These include:

- Service Account: A dedicated service account for Homarr.
- Role & RoleBinding: Grants permissions within a specific namespace to list, watch, and get pods, services, secrets, configmaps, and more.
- ClusterRole & ClusterRoleBinding: Extends the same permissions cluster-wide for additional flexibility.

## Homarr Dashboard Overview

Once deployed, Homarr provides a dashboard displaying Kubernetes metrics and resource information. The main page includes:

- Pods: Lists running and pending pods.
- Services: Shows available services and their configurations.
- Ingresses: Displays ingress rules and associated routes.
- Nodes: Provides an overview of cluster nodes and their status.
- ConfigMaps & Secrets: Lists configuration data and secrets used within the cluster.
- Namespaces: Displays all available namespaces in the cluster.
- Volumes: Shows persistent and ephemeral storage resources.
