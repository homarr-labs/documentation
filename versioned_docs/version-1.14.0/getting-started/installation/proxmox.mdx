# Proxmox

This guide covers how to install homarr inside of a linux-container in ProxmoxVE, using a fully automated approach.

# What is community-scripts?

https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/

This installation method is provided by the Proxmox Community-Scripts. We are a community-driven initiative that simplifies the setup of Proxmox Virtual Environment (VE).
With hundreds of scripts to help you manage your Proxmox VE environment. Whether you're a seasoned user or a newcomer, we've got you covered.

# Installation

It's as simple as pasting the following snippet into your Proxmox node's console

```bash
bash -c "$(wget -qLO - https://github.com/community-scripts/ProxmoxVE/raw/main/ct/homarr.sh)"
```

:::warning
Never trust any script directly injected from the web, without prior looking through it or searching the web for other's opinions.

:::

After executing this command, you will get asked, if you want to accept defaults or would like to specify things like IP-Adress, DNS etc, then choose advanced.

After confirming the installation, the script will install the required dependencies, which may take a few minutes. Do not interrupt the installation.
After you've installed Homarr, you can find a new LXC "homarr".

# Updating

Updating is as simple as executing 

```bash
update
```

or running the script again but this time inside the container's shell:

```bash
bash -c "$(wget -qLO - https://github.com/community-scripts/ProxmoxVE/raw/main/ct/homarr.sh)"
```

# Troubleshooting

If something does not work after an update, please first try rebooting the LXC or the homarr Service with 

```bash
systemctl restart homarr
```

# Getting help

# How to find logs
Homarr runs under a system service called `homarr`, so getting the logs is a simple as using the following command inside the LXC (Container) Shell

```bash
systemctl status homarr
```

As Homarr logs really a log, it sometimes feels like the log is endless till you get the bottom, so a command like this only shows the latest 100 lines:

```bash
journalctl -u homarr | tail -n 100
```
