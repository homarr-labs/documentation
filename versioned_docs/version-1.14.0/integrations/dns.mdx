# DNS

Homarr allows the integration of DNS-holes to control them and display their stats.
Multiple DNS-holes can be added at the same time.

## PiHole
The PiHole integration enables you to see basic stats like the number of queries in the day and how many are blocked.

You can also disable and enable it using the dns-hole control widget.

For a successful integration, remember that the internal address should not have a path, only the IP and the port (``http://ip:port``).

In this case it would mean to remove anything of the likes of "/admin" from the link you would usually use.

:::note
Homarr supports both PiHole v5 and v6.
It automatically detects the version and uses the correct API.

  We suggest to use the application password when possible.
