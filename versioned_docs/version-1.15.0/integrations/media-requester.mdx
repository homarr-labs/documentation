# Media requests
## Initial configuration
The [Overseerr](https://overseerr.dev/) / [Jellyseerr](https://github.com/Fallenbagel/jellyseerr) integration will enable you to request
movies and series directly from your Homarr dashboard.
Both integrations use [the search engine feature of Homarr](/docs/management/search-engines/) and require some additional configuration.

To start, create a new integration of the type `Overseerr` or `Jellyseerr``.
Next, create a new search engine and choose the option "From integration":
