If you're running a Unifi Controller instance, you might want to display statistics on your dashboard.
It uses the [node-unifi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-unifi) library under the hood, which supports
CloudKey Gen1, CloudKey Gen2, UnifiOS-based UDM-Pro controllers as well as self-hosted UniFi controllers.

There are two variations of the widget:
- **Summary of the systems**: Shows information whether your WAN is connected, Wi-Fi is active and several other information
- **Network information**: Connected users and connected guest devices on wired or wireless networks

It requires the [Unifi Controller integration](/docs/next/integrations/unifi-controller) to be configured.
