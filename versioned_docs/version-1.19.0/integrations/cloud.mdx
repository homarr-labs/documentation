## Nextcloud
You can integrate your Nextcloud instance's calendar using this integration.
Homarr will then display your calendar appointments in the calendar widget.

:::note

Currently, 2FA will break this integration because Homarr can't authenticate
with username and password in that case. Disable 2FA as a workaround.
