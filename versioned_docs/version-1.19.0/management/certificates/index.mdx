# Certificates
On this page you can manage your trusted certificates. 
For example if you use a self signed certificate for one of the integrations you want to connect, you can add it here.

Below you can see a screenshot of the certificates page. 
The items show the subject, filename and when it expires. 
The color of the icon indicates how long it is valid.

| ðŸŸ¨ Yellow | Valid for less than 30 days |

## Managing it through file system

The certificates are stored in the `/appdata/trusted-certificates` directory which is mounted through `/appdata`.
This means you can automate the update of the certificates by simply replacing or adding a new file in the directory.
