# Docker
Docker is our recommended installation method for beginners and professionals.
It is easy to use, ships with all dependencies inside a single container and is easy to use and maintain.
It requires at least some basic knowledge of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
We recommend [NetworkChuck's Docker Containers 101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGz9DS-aIeY) as a good start for complete beginners.

## Docker compose
### Prerequisites

- A Linux or Windows based system that meets the [hardware prerequisites](/docs/getting-started/#hardware) and [architecture prerequisites](/docs/getting-started/#architecture).
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) - *preinstalled on many systems nowadays*

### Installation

<DockerInstallSnippet data-visual-test="blackout"/>
Finally, run ``docker compose up -d`` in the same directory. This will start the Homarr container in the background.

:::caution

Docker compose creates a network by default. Some integrations may not work (specifically Dash.) when the network internal hostname is used since clients do not know this name. It is recommended that you either use a local network wide hostname or the IP directly. An alternative is to create a DNS record with the same internal compose stack hostname for all clients outside.

### Updating

To update, navigate to the directory with the ``docker-compose.yaml`` located.

- Stop Homarr using ``docker compose down``
- Pull the newest image of Homarr using ``docker compose pull``
- Start Homarr again using ``docker compose up -d`` (``-d`` for detached mode - start in background)
- Delete the old image using ``docker image prune`` (*Warning: this also removes you other unused images - not just Homarr*)

You can automate this process using [Watchtower](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/).

### Uninstalling

To uninstall, navigate to the directory with the ``docker-compose.yaml`` located.

- Stop Homarr using ``docker compose down``
- Delete the created directories & files on your root file system (check ``docker-compose.yaml`` file for your specific locations)
- Delete compose file using ``rm docker-compose.yaml``
- Prune unused Docker images using ``docker image prune`` (*Warning: this also removes you other unused images - not just Homarr*)
- (Optional): Prune any network or volumes if you use any.
- (Optional): Remove Homarr from your reverse proxy, VPNs or tunnels if you use any.


## Docker standalone

:::caution

[Docker Compose](#docker-compose) is easier and recommended for beginners. Consider using compose instead.

:::

### Prerequisites

- A Linux or Windows based system that meets the [hardware prerequisites](/docs/getting-started/#hardware) and [architecture prerequisites](/docs/getting-started/#architecture).
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

### Installation

To install Homarr using Docker, simply run the following command.

```bash
docker run  \
  --name homarr \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 7575:7575 \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v <your-path>/homarr/appdata:/appdata \
  -e SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY='your_64_character_hex_string' \
  -d ghcr.io/homarr-labs/homarr:latest
```

:::note

Docker will mount the configuration files and icons to your host machine. Please make sure to replace ``<your-path>`` from the docker run command with your desired storage location. The path must be absolute.

:::

### Updating
To update Homarr, you must remove your container first. Make sure that you've mounted your data and that you have access to it, so your configuration doesn't get lost.

1. Run ``docker rm homarr`` to remove the container.
2. Pull the latest Homarr image ``docker pull ghcr.io/homarr-labs/homarr:latest``.
3. Re-run the command you used to install Homarr.

This process can get tideous, if you update frequently. Thus, we recommend [using docker-compose](#docker-compose)

:::tip

Want to update all your containers automatically? Checkout [Watchtower](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/) a service which will automatically update your containers on a set interval.

:::

### Uninstalling

1. Obtain the container ID of your Homarr container using ``docker ps | grep homarr``.
2. Delete the container using ``docker rm <your-container-id>``
3. Prune unused Docker images using ``docker image prune`` (*Warning: this also removes you other unused images - not just Homarr*)
4. (Optional): Prune any network or volumes if you use any.
5. (Optional): Remove Homarr from your reverse proxy, VPNs or tunnels if you use any.
