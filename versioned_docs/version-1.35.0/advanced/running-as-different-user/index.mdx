By default the container is running with user `root` and group `root`. 
You can change the user and group by using the `PUID` and `PGID` environment variables.
Important to note is, that you'll also need to change the permissions for the mounted directories accordingly.

:::info
When starting up an updated version of the container it will have about **10 seconds longer to start** as it has to change the permissions of the app directories

## Without mounted Docker socket

To run your container as a different user, you can use the `PUID` and `PGID` environment variables:

```yml title="docker-compose.yml"
#---------------------------------------------------------------------#
#     Homarr - A simple, yet powerful dashboard for your server.      #
#---------------------------------------------------------------------#
services:
  homarr:
    container_name: homarr
    image: ghcr.io/homarr-labs/homarr:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - ./homarr/appdata:/appdata
    environment:
        - SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_64_character_hex_string # <--- can be generated with `openssl rand -hex 32`
        - PUID=1000
        - PGID=1000
    ports:
      - '7575:7575'
```

After that you'll need to create the appdata directory and set the correct permissions:

```bash title="On host"
mkdir -p ./homarr/appdata
chown -R 1000:1000 ./homarr/appdata
```

## With mounted Docker socket

If you want to use the Docker integration, you'll need to set the correct permissions for the Docker socket as well, most of the times it will have the owner group set to docker group.
In any way, it is recommended to create this group and set it's permissions to it, if it doesn't exist yet:

```bash title="On host"
groupadd -g 999 docker
```

Then you can set the permissions for the Docker socket:

```bash title="On host"
chown root:docker /var/run/docker.sock
```

After that you can set the `PUID` and `PGID` environment variables in your `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yml title="docker-compose.yml"
#---------------------------------------------------------------------#
#     Homarr - A simple, yet powerful dashboard for your server.      #
#---------------------------------------------------------------------#
services:
  homarr:
    container_name: homarr
    image: ghcr.io/homarr-labs/homarr:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      - ./homarr/appdata:/appdata
    environment:
        - SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_64_character_hex_string # <--- can be generated with `openssl rand -hex 32`
        - PUID=1000
        - PGID=999
    ports:
      - '7575:7575'
```

And set the permissions for the mounted directories:

```bash title="On host"
mkdir -p ./homarr/appdata
chown -R 1000:999 ./homarr/appdata
```

Important here is that the group ID is set to `999` as we created the `docker` group with this ID.
