# Fix usernames

:::info

This guide requires that you understand [how to access the CLI](../).

:::

If you somehow get into a situation where you have users with usernames that contain uppercase characters and you are no longer able to log in, you can use the following command to fix the usernames.

```bash
homarr fix-usernames
```

This will convert all credential usernames to lowercase and update the database accordingly.
