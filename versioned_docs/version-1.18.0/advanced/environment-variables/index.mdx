Homarr offers a Docker Container, which can be run on any compatible system, such as Unraid, Kubernetes and many more systems! Our Docker container is based on the ``22.12.0-alpine`` image and serves per standard on the port `7575`.

---

Homarr offers a few environment variables, which can be used to configure the container.

## General

:::warning
Using the `PUID` and `PGID` will require you to set the correct permissions on the mounted volumes and if used the docker socket. See more in the [Running as a different user](/docs/advanced/running-as-different-user) documentation.

| ``LOG_LEVEL``           | Log level to use | ``debug`` / ``info`` / ``warn`` / ``error`` | ``info`` |


## Authentication

See [Single Sign-On](/docs/advanced/single-sign-on) for more informations.
