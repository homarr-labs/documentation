# Donate
## Why to donate
Our team of 4 developers is working on Homarr in their free time.
Homarr has become a big part of our daily things we work on - and therefore we invest a lot of time into maintaining Homarr,
providing support and implementing new features.
We also incur monetary costs while developing Homarr for the tools that we need.
A few examples include:
- Renting for a Cloud VPS for our cloud services (status page, monitoring, email, analytics, demo instance, ...)
- Paying for (IDE-) licenses

Using a donation, you help us to cover these expenses and enable the development of Homarr.
Homarr is completely free to use. We'd highly appreciate if you consider donating, especially if you use Homarr in a commercial environment.

## Where to donate
We accept donations on our official [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/homarr).
You may also sponsor us directly by providing a useful service / product to us other means.
You can get into contact with us [here](./get-in-touch).
