6. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and replace `DB_URL` with the full path you want to use for the sqlite database file. For example `DB_URL='C:\\Dev\\homarr\\packages\\db\\db.sqlite'`

7. Run the migrations to create the sqlite db file with `pnpm run db:migration:sqlite:run`.

8. Start the development server with `pnpm dev` and wait for a message that says `âœ“ Ready in 10.7s`

9. Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). (Loading the page might take up to 2 minutes the first time)
