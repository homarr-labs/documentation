# Settings
The settings page has a few options that will be applied to the entire Homarr application.
They may require a full page reload for changes to apply.

## Analytics
By default, Homarr is collecting anonymous analytics to identify issues and prioritize bugfixes and improvements.
The data is never shared with any third-parties and is fully GDPR & CCPA compliant.
The software being used is [Umami Analytics](https://umami.is/) which is fully open source.
The main server software can be found [here](https://github.com/umami-software/umami) and [this node library](https://github.com/umami-software/node) to perform server side calls to the API.

A full list of the collected data by default can be found here: https://umami.is/docs/metric-definitions.

We understand that you might not want Homarr to communicate with our services.
By unchecking the ``Send anonymous analytics`` checkbox and reloading the full page, all communication by Umami will be disabled and no data will be collected.
If you are paranoid, you can permanently block ``umami.homarr.dev`` from your DNS / firewall.

Additionally, you opt in to more data collection to help us provide more useful data.

### Integration data
Enabling this optional data will send the types of integrations (e.g. SABnzbd, Sonarr, ...) and how many you have configured of them.
This will not include any URLs, names, secrets, errors and others. This is disabled by default.

### Widget data
Enabling this optional data will send the types of widgets (e.g. downloads, media streams, iframe, ...) and how many you have configured of them.
This will not include any URLs, names, secrets, errors and others. This is disabled by default.

### Users data
Enabling this optional data will send the count of users and whether you activated SSO.
This will not include any usernames, passwords, emails, URLs, authentication flows or client IDs.
This is disabled by default.

## Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
Big companies [like Google, Microsoft, Baidu and Yandex](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web-Index) will use [web crawlers](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webcrawler) to index the Internet for new websites & pages.
This is desirable in many cases (for example when selling products in an online shop) but can lead to unwanted traffic and attention to your personal dashboard.
Homarr is requesting the crawlers to not index Homarr instances by default for this reason.
If you use Homarr as a public website and want it to be searchable on these search engines, you can disable these settings.
Please note that Homarr doesn't have control over what the crawlers do; it is a mere request to them to not perform these actions but will not guarantee that your website doesn't land on some index.

### No index
This will ask crawlers to not index your Homarr instance on any indexes.
It is up to the crawler to properly respect this request.
By default, this setting is enabled. Disabling it will allow indexing.

### No follow
If indexing is allowed, crawlers will also attempt to follow any links on your page to further "discover" new parts of the Internet and on your website.
By default, this setting is enabled and will ask crawlers to not follow any links.
Crawler of different companies may behave differently when indexing is prohibited and following is allowed.

### No translate
Google and Chrome on Android will prompt users to translate pages that are not in their device language.
This can lead to some shifting and can be undesired in some cases. By enabling this,
you ask crawlers to never translate and never prompt users for translation.
It should be noted that some browsers will ignore this and translate regardless.

### No site links search box
This setting is exclusive to Google.
[Google will create a box below your domain](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/sitelinks-searchbox) that lists the paths that were discovered by the "folowing".
The user can search them directly in Google.
You can ask the crawlers to not allow searches by enabling this setting.
This setting is disabled by default.

## Boards

### Global home board
You can set a global home board that will be used for all users that have not set a home board themselves. 
It will also be used for anonymous users.
Note that the board must be public to be used as a global home board.

### Global mobile board

You can set a global mobile board. It will be shown instead of the global home board on mobile devices that can be detected by Homarr. (Using the User-Agent header).
It will similar to the global home board be as fallback for normal users and for any anonymous users.
It also has to be public.

### App status

#### Enable status by default

You can decide if the app status should be enabled by default when adding a new app to the board.

#### Force disable status

You can decide if the app status should be disabled for all boards.
