# Network

Homarr allows the integration of network controllers to display their stats.
Multiple network controllers can be added at the same time.

## Unifi Controller
The Unifi Controller integration enables you to see basic stats with the help of the [Network Controller widget](/docs/next/widgets/network-controller). It is created to support the normal and pro variants of the Unifi Controller.

It is used to show some metrics like www ping, the number of users in different kinds of networks like LAN and WiFi.

For a successful integration you have to make sure of the following:

* Remember that the internal address should not have a path, only the fqdn on SSL (``https://unifi.local``). In this case it would mean to remove anything of the likes of "`/api`" from the link you would usually use.
* Since the Unifi Controller only runs on SSL, it usually creates a self-signed certificate on the fqdn `unifi.local`. You will have to: 
  * put in your own certificate into the Unifi Controller if you use another fqdn 
  * **OR**
  * make sure your Unifi Controller can be reached through the fqdn `unifi.local` 
  * get your certificate from the Unifi Controller with a browser by downloading it
  * [add the certificate](/docs/management/certificates) to the Homarr instance
* You have to create a user (can be *Restrict*ed *to Local Access Only*) with at least the following permissions:
  * Network: Full Management
  * Control Plane: View Only

**NOTICE**: The integration does currently **NOT** support the "*Unifi Network API*" with the "*Control Plane API keys*".
