# 🎬 Media servers

Homarr can integrate with your media servers, which allows you to control it from your dashboard.
You may add multiple media servers, also of different kinds, to your dashboard.

:::tip

We recommend creating a separate account just for Homarr. Only grant access to the libraries and permissions that you require to be accessed by Homarr. This allows for better security.

## Plex
The Plex integration enables you to view the active sessions, using the [Media Server widget](../widgets/media-server), on your dashboard.

For a successful integration, remember that the internal address should not have a path, only the IP and the port (http://IP:port).

In this case it would mean to remove anything of the likes of "/web/index.html" from the link you would usually use.
