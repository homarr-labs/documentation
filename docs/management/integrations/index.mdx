Integrations are a useful way to further connect and manage your network.
They may require additional configuration in or outside Homarr.
An integration cannot be added by itself.
You must configure an app to a specific integration.
Most integration will then fill widgets with data or add functionality to
other parts of Homarr.

The following integrations are available:

- [Torrent Clients](#torrent-clients)
  - [Deluge](#deluge)
  - [Transmission](#transmission)
  - [qBittorrent](#qbittorrent-integration)
- [Usenet Clients](#usenet-clients)
  - [SABnzbd](#sabnzbd)
  - [NZBGet](#nzbget)
- [Collection Managers](#collection-managers)
  - [Sonarr](#sonarr) (series)
  - [Radarr](#radarr) (movies)
  - [Lidarr](#lidarr) (music)
  - [Readarr](#readarr) (books)
- [Media Servers](#media-servers)
  - [Jellyfin](#jellyfin)
  - [Plex](#plex)
- [Dash.](#dash)
- [Overseerr & Jellyseerr](#overseerr--jellyseerr) (media requests)
- [Docker](#docker)

:::caution

Homarr usually does not support ``beta``, ``alpha`` or older legacy versions of integrations, because new versions often contain breaking API changes.
We will not support these, because the underlying API often changes frequently and would require much attention for very little outcome.

## Media Servers
Homarr can integrate with your media servers, which allows you to control it from your dashboard.
You may add multiple media servers, also of different kinds, to your dashboard.

:::tip

We recommend creating a separate account just for Homarr. Only grant access to the libraries and permissions that you require to be accessed by Homarr. This allows for better security.

:::


### Jellyfin
The Jellyfin integration enables you to view the active sessions, using the [Media Server widget](../widgets/media-server), on your dashboard.

### Plex
The Plex integration enables you to view the active sessions, using the [Media Server widget](../widgets/media-server), on your dashboard.

For a successful integration, remember that the internal address should not have a path, only the IP and the port (http://IP:port).

In this case it would mean to remove anything of the likes of "/web/index.html" from the link you would usually use.

### Initial setup
#### Installation of Media Server
The Overseer integration supports both Overseerr and Jellyseerr, a fork of Overseerr compatible with Jellyfin.

<Tabs groupId="media-server">
  <TabItem value="plex" label="ðŸŽ¬ Plex Media Server">
    <p>
      Install Plex on your machine using your preferred installation method: <a href="https://www.plex.tv/">https://www.plex.tv/</a><br/>
      We recommend the installation using Docker for the easiest and fastest installation.
    </p>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="jellyfin" label="ðŸŽ¬ Jellyfin Media Server">

      Install Jellyfin on your machine using your preferred installation method: <a href="https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/administration/installing.html">https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/administration/installing.html</a><br/>

    </p>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Installation of Media requester

<Tabs groupId="media-server">
  <TabItem value="plex" label="ðŸŽ¬ Plex Media Server">
    <p>
      After you have your Plex instance up and running, you must install Overseer as your media request application. Please read the official documentation of how to install Overseerr on your machine: <a href="https://docs.overseerr.dev/getting-started/installation">https://docs.overseerr.dev/getting-started/installation</a>.
    </p>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="jellyfin" label="ðŸŽ¬ Jellyfin Media Server">
    <p>
      Officially, Jellyfin is not supported by Overseerr. This is why Jellyfin users must use a fork of the official Overseerr project, which was modified to work with Jellyfin: <a href="https://github.com/Fallenbagel/jellyseerr">https://github.com/Fallenbagel/jellyseerr</a>.<br/>
      We recommend the installation using Docker for the easiest and fastest installation.
    </p>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Add your application in Homarr
If your instance of Overseerr or Jellyseerr is up and running, it's time to add it to your dashboard.
Simply select the correct type from the integration tab when editing the application:

![](img/overseerr/add-application.webp)

<Tabs groupId="media-server">
  <TabItem value="plex" label="ðŸŽ¬ Plex Media Server">
    <p>
      Select <code>Overseerr</code> in the app type for your Overseerr app.<br/>
      Fill our the field <code>Api token</code> with from the link below, when having <code>Overseerr</code> as the app type selected.
    </p>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="jellyfin" label="ðŸŽ¬ Jellyfin Media Server">
    <p>
      Select <code>Jellyseerr</code> in the app type for your Jellyseerr app.<br/>
      Fill our the field <code>Api token</code> with from the link below, when having <code>Jellyseerr</code> as the app type selected.
    </p>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Searching for a movie / series
To search for a movie or series, simply press ``CTRL`` + ``K`` or click into the search box.
Then, type ``!os`` (with a space at the end) and enter, what you want to search for.

The integration will display, what content is already available in your media library.

### Seasons selection
If you're selecting a series, you'll be asked what seasons you want to request:

![season selector](img/overseerr/widget-overseerr-season-select.webp)

## DNS Holes
Homarr allows the integration of DHS-holes to control them and display their stats.
Multiple DNS-holes can be added at the same time.
Currently, only PiHole and AdGuard Home are supported.

### PiHole
The PiHole integration enables you to see basic stats like the number of queries in the day and how many are blocked.

You can also disable and enable it using the dns-hole control widget.

For a successful integration, remember that the internal address should not have a path, only the IP and the port (http://IP:port).

In this case it would mean to remove anything of the likes of "/admin" from the link you would usually use.

## Dash.

The Dash. integration can be used to monitor the performance and used system resources of your machine.
Dash. will be used in the [Dash.](/docs/widgets/dashdot-widget)

---

## Docker

Homarr allows you to interact with Docker containers running on your system.

You can **restart**, **stop**, **start**, **refresh** and **remove** containers as well as **add** them to the Homarr dashboard

![Docker Core Features](img/docker-core-features.png)

Additionally, if you have a lot of containers you can search and filter them by **container** or **image** name

![Container and Image Search](img/container-and-image-search.png)

View the state of each container (**created**, **running** or **stopped**)

![Container States](img/container-states.png)

And also check what ports the container has exposed (container port:external port)

![Exposed Ports](img/exposed-ports.png)


### Before you begin
In order for Homarr to be able to interact with your Docker instance you must tell Homarr the path to your Docker socket.  You do this by adding the following to the Docker command when you first run Homarr:

`-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock`

If you are running Docker Desktop on Windows 10, use the following path to your Docker socket:

`-v //var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock`
