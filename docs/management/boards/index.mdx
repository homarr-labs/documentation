Each dashboard is called a "board".
You can create as many boards as you want.
Each board will be listed on this page.
Every user on your Homarr instance can access this page and choose a default dashboard using the three dots on any of the boards.
A user can navigate to their default page using the shortlink ``YOUR-HOMARR-HOSTNAME/board``.

## Create a new board

1. Click the button "Create new board" at the top right
2. Enter a name for the board
3. Click on the "Create" button

## Managing and editing boards
To edit and manage a board, click on the big "View board" button.
Only logged-in administrators can edit boards.
To further limit who has access to your board you can use the [board customizations](/docs/advanced/customizations/board-customization).
