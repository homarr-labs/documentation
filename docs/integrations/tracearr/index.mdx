## Configuration

Tracearr connects to Homarr via its URL and an API key. The API key is sent using the `X-Api-Key` header.

### Finding your API Key

1. Open Tracearr and navigate to **Settings** → **API**.
2. Click **Generate API Key** (or copy an existing key).
3. Copy the key and paste it into the Homarr integration configuration.

### Test Connection

When adding the integration, Homarr will validate connectivity and confirm that your API key has the required permissions.

### Adding the integration
<AddingIntegration />

### Secrets
<IntegrationSecrets secrets={[{
    credentials: ['apiKey'],
    steps: [
        <span>
            In Tracearr, go to <strong>Settings → API</strong> and generate or copy your API key.
        </span>
    ]
}]} />
