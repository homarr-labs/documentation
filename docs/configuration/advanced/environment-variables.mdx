Homarr offers a Docker Container, which can be run on any compatible system, such as Unraid, Kubernetes and many more systems! Our Docker container is based on the ``node:16-alpine`` image and serves per standard on the port `7575`.

---

Homarr offers a few environment variables, which can be used to configure the container.

| Environment Variable     | Section |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| ``DEFAULT_COLOR_SCHEME`` | [](#docker-integration)  |
| ``PORT``                 | [Web server settings](#web-server-settings) |
| ``DOCKER_HOST``          | [Docker Integration](#docker-integration) |
| ``DOCKER_PORT``          | [Docker Integration](#docker-integration) |
| ``TZ``                   | [Timezone](#timezone-settings) |
| ``DISABLE_ANALYTICS``    | [Anonymous analytics](#anonymous-analytics) |

## Colors and preferences

| Environment key          | Possible values      | Default   |
| ------------------------ | -------------------- | --------- |
| ``DEFAULT_COLOR_SCHEME`` | ``dark`` / ``light`` | ``light`` |

You can change the default color theme for all users using this environment variable.
However, this will be overwritten on a per-user basis if they selected another theme in the application.
This is mostly useful for new users.

## Web server settings

| Environment key | Possible values            | Default   |
| --------------- | -------------------------- | --------- |
| ``PORT``        | any valid networking Port  | 7575      |

By default, Homarr will run on port ``7575``. However, you might want to change this for advanced setups or if you're running in ``host`` network mode.

## Docker Integration

| Environment key       | Possible values            | Default   |
| --------------------- | -------------------------- | --------- |
| ``DOCKER_HOST``       | ``unix:///var/run/docker.sock`` or ``tcp://<ip>:<port>`` | -         |
| ``DOCKER_PORT``       | any valid networking Port  | -         |

If the Docker instance you want to connect to is not on the same machine, then you can use ``unix:`` or ``tcp:`` protocols instead.
This will enable you to control a completly different machine over your network.

## Timezone Settings

| Environment key       | Possible values      | Default   |
| --------------------- | -------------------- | --------- |
| ``TZ``                | Any TZ identifier from [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) | your local time zone |

Some users might experience wrong dates/times in their [Calendar](/docs/widgets/calendar-widget). This is because the Calendar is using the server-side time. Although you should always set your host machine to your local time zone, you should specify the timezone for Homarr to ensure that the timezone is always set correctly.

:::tip

Unsure what your timezone is? You can find yours on [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones). Simply copy the value of the column "TZ database name".

Please note that this should work on nearly all systems. Check out these two amazing articles by howtogeek on timezones in containers:

## Anonymous Analytics

| Environment key       | Possible values      | Default   |
| --------------------- | -------------------- | --------- |
| ``DISABLE_ANALYTICS`` | ``true`` / ``false`` | ``false`` |

By default we collect anonymous analytics when you visit https://homarr.dev or your personal Homarr instance.
As a fully open source project we value privacy as much as you do.
For that reason we aren't using Google Analytics and use [Umami Analytics](https://umami.is/) instead.
We use this data to evaluate and prioritize new features or improvements to Homarr.
All of your data is anonymized before it is sent to the server.
You can disable this data reporting by setting the environment variable ``DISABLE_ANALYTICS`` to ``true``.

Alternatively, you can block any outgoing requests to ``umami.homarr.dev`` on your firewall.
We will never sell this data or track your specific user activity.
