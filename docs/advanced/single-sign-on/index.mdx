# Single Sign On

Homarr supports multiple authentication options, from internal userbase (credentials), to LDAP (with Active directory support), and OIDC.

### Auth configuration common variables
| Environment Variable      | Description | Default Value |
|---------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| AUTH_PROVIDERS             | Select Which provider to use between *credentials*, *ldap* and *oidc*. <br /> Multiple providers can be enabled with by separating them with `,`, (ex. `AUTH_PROVIDERS=credentials,oidc`, it is highly recommended to just enable one provider).  |  credentials  |
| AUTH_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL  | URL to redirect to after clicking logging out.  | --- |
| AUTH_SESSION_EXPIRY_TIME  | Time for the session to time out. Can be set as pure number, which will automatically be used in seconds, or followed by s, m, h or d for seconds, minutes, hours or days. (ex: "30m") | "30d"  |

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="credentials" label="Credentials Provider" default>

    This is the default provider.

    First user is created using the onboarding process and the rest can be created by this user (see [user management](/docs/management/users))

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ldap" label="LDAP provider">

    This provider authenticates against an LDAP server.

    Any user in LDAP server that signs in gets created in Homarr database.

    Roles are fetched from LDAP groups. Groups with the same name of Homarr will be used to synchronize them.

        Example Setup
      </summary>
      <div>

        In this setup we are using [lldap](https://github.com/lldap/lldap). Install your server using docker or [as a service](https://github.com/lldap/lldap/blob/main/example_configs/lldap.service).

        Minimal configuration requires 4 env variables, LDAP URI, base, user and password for querying data.

        There's more variables, but all have defaults corresponding to lldap defaults. These might need to be changed if you have different LDAP provider.
        ```
        docker run ...
        AUTH_PROVIDERS="ldap"
        AUTH_LDAP_URI="ldap://example.com:3890"
        AUTH_LDAP_BASE="dc=example,dc=com" // Same as LLDAP_LDAP_BASE_DN
        AUTH_LDAP_BIND_DN="uid=admin,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com"
        AUTH_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORD="adminpass" // Same as LLDAP_LDAP_USER_PASS
        ```
        ```
        #Docker compose
        version: x
        services:
          homarr:
            environment:
              AUTH_PROVIDERS: ldap
              AUTH_LDAP_URI: ldap://example.com:3890
              AUTH_LDAP_BASE: dc=example,dc=com #Same as LLDAP_LDAP_BASE_DN
              AUTH_LDAP_BIND_DN: uid=admin,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com
              AUTH_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORD: adminpass #Same as LLDAP_LDAP_USER_PASS
        ```

        In lldap, create a user and admin group, assign this user to the external admin group configured during onboarding. You can log in using this user and he will be in the group.

        Here is another example for Active Directory:

        ```
        AUTH_LDAP_URI="ldap://ldap.abc.xyz:389
        AUTH_LDAP_BASE="DC=abc,DC=xyz"
        AUTH_LDAP_BIND_DN="CN=Administrator,CN=Users,DC=abc,DC=xyz"
        AUTH_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORD="YourAdministratorPassword"
        AUTH_LDAP_USERNAME_ATTRIBUTE="sAMAccountName"
        AUTH_LDAP_USER_MAIL_ATTRIBUTE="userPrincipalName"
        AUTH_LDAP_GROUP_CLASS="group"
        AUTH_LDAP_GROUP_MEMBER_ATTRIBUTE="member"
        AUTH_LDAP_GROUP_MEMBER_USER_ATTRIBUTE="dn"
        AUTH_LDAP_SEARCH_SCOPE="sub"
        AUTH_LDAP_USERNAME_FILTER_EXTRA_ARG="(sAMAccountType=805306368)"
        ```
        User mail attribute is set to userPrincipalName as it follows the right schema, but it is recommended to use real emails and the default 'mail' value.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="oidc" label="OIDC provider">

    This provider authenticates using OIDC protocol.

    Users signed in using OIDC are created in Homarr.

    Roles are fetched from group claims. This can also be changed to roles for example added to a azure app registration by using the `AUTH_OIDC_GROUPS_ATTRIBUTE`.

    <details>
      <summary>
        Example Setup
      </summary>
      <div>

        In this example we will be using [Authelia](https://github.com/authelia/authelia).

        You can use any setup, but the simplest is [local](https://github.com/authelia/authelia/blob/master/examples/compose/local/authelia/configuration.yml).

        You also have to [enable OIDC in Authelia](https://www.authelia.com/configuration/identity-providers/open-id-connect/).

        Create a client for homarr. To generate client secret you can [use authelia](https://www.authelia.com/integration/openid-connect/frequently-asked-questions/#how-do-i-generate-client-secrets). This is an example config:

        ```yaml
        identity_providers:
        oidc:
        ...
        clients:
        - id: homarr
        secret: <secret_hash>
        public: false
        authorization_policy: one_factor
        redirect_uris:
        - https://example.com/api/auth/callback/oidc
        - http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/oidc
        scopes:
        - openid
        - groups
        - profile
        - email
        userinfo_signing_algorithm: none
        consent_mode: implicit # self hosted
        ```

        In Homarr use following env variables.

        ```
        AUTH_PROVIDERS="oidc"
        AUTH_OIDC_ISSUER="https://auth.example.com"
        AUTH_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET="client_secret"
        AUTH_OIDC_CLIENT_ID="homarr"
        AUTH_OIDC_CLIENT_NAME="Authelia"
        AUTH_OIDC_FORCE_USERINFO="true" --> from v4.39 of authelia and above this is required
        ```

        For an azure app registration the setup could look like this:

        ```
        AUTH_PROVIDERS="oidc"
        AUTH_OIDC_ISSUER="https://login.microsoftonline.com/<teanant-id>/v2.0"
        AUTH_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET="<client-secret>"
        AUTH_OIDC_CLIENT_ID="<client-id>"
        AUTH_OIDC_CLIENT_NAME="Azure"
        AUTH_OIDC_SCOPE_OVERWRITE="openid email profile" # Groups scope does not exist in azure
        AUTH_OIDC_GROUPS_ATTRIBUTE="roles" # We use the roles of the app registration so that we don't need to use uuids as our groups
        ```

      </div>
    </details>


    ### Configuration

    | Environment Variable        | Description                                                | Default value |
    |-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
    | ``AUTH_OIDC_ISSUER``        | Issuer URI of OIDC provider. This has generally to be **without trailing slash** except for **Authentik** | ---           |
    | ``AUTH_OIDC_CLIENT_ID``     | ID of OIDC client (application)                            | ---           |
    | ``AUTH_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`` | Secret of OIDC client (application)                        | ---           |
    | ``AUTH_OIDC_CLIENT_NAME``   | Display name of provider (in login screen)                 | OIDC          |
    | ``AUTH_OIDC_AUTO_LOGIN``    | Automatically redirect to OIDC login                       | false         |
    | ``AUTH_OIDC_SCOPE_OVERWRITE`` | Overwrite default scopes (openid, profile, email)        | openid email profile groups           |
    | ``AUTH_OIDC_GROUPS_ATTRIBUTE`` | Attribute used for groups (roles) claim                  | groups        |
    | ``AUTH_OIDC_NAME_ATTRIBUTE_OVERWRITE`` | Overwrite name attribute. By default it will use preferred_username if it does not contain a `@` and otherwise name. | ---          |
    | ``AUTH_OIDC_FORCE_USERINFO`` | Force userinfo endpoint to be used for user information.    | false         |

    ### Permission System 

    To give a user special permissions, first create a new group in homarr and assign the permission desired.
    For example if the group on homarr is called `homarr-admins` a new group on the oidc provider, for example authentik needs to be created with the same name, that would be `homarr-admins`.
    After assigning the group on the oidc provider to the user, and logging again into homarr, the user should automatically get placed in that group and inherit the permissions defined.
