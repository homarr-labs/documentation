# Proxmox

This guide covers how to install homarr inside of a linux-container in ProxmoxVE, using a fully automated approach.

# What is community-scripts?

https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/

We are a community-driven initiative that simplifies the setup of Proxmox Virtual Environment (VE).
With hundreds of scripts to help you manage your Proxmox VE environment. Whether you're a seasoned user or a newcomer, we've got you covered.

# Installation

It's as simple as pasting the following snippet into your Proxmox Node's console

```bash
bash -c "$(wget -qLO - https://github.com/community-scripts/ProxmoxVE/raw/main/ct/homarr.sh)"
```

:::warning
Never trust any script directly injected from the web, without prior looking through it or searching the web for other's opinions.

After executing this command, you will get asked, if you want to accept defaults or would like to specify things like IP-Adress, DNS etc, then choose advanced.
The installation part takes a moment, but you there is a nice progress-spinner.

After you've installed Homarr, you can find a new LXC "homarr".

# Updating

Updating is as simple as executing 

```bash
update
```

or running the script again but this time inside the container's shell:

```bash
bash -c "$(wget -qLO - https://github.com/community-scripts/ProxmoxVE/raw/main/ct/homarr.sh)"
```

# Troubleshooting

If something does not work after an update, please first try rebooting the LXC or the homarr Service with 

```bash
systemctl restart homarr
```

# Getting help

The official support of community-scripts is located [here](https://discord.gg/2wvnMDgdnU) if you feel like there is an issue with the script, feel free ot open a github issue [here](https://github.com/community-scripts/ProxmoxVE/issues/new/choose)

If you feel like the issue is at homarr side, please ask on the homarr Discord or Github instead.

# How to find logs
Homarr runs under a system service called `homarr`, so getting the logs is a simple as using

```bash
systemctl status homarr
```

As homarr logs really a log, it sometimes feels like the log is endless till you get the bottom, so a command like this only shows the latest 100 lines:

```bash
journalctl -u homarr | tail -n 100
```
