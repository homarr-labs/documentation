If you application is not supported natively by Homarr, you can integrate it using the iframe widget.
It uses the [iframe element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe),
which embeds the desired page in the browser.
This means, no traffic is routed through Homarr (and the URL must be reachable from the client).

Athough you can integrate many websites, some may not work.
This is because the administrators of those sites disallow iframes
for security reasons, as users could easily be tricked
by embeding the original site on a malicious page.

Some proxies disallow iframes by default for this reason.
You can use https://iframetester.com/ to check, if the site is allowing iframes.
If you manage all of your own applications, you can usually change that.

If you want to test a page, you can use the following URL:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page

iframes can be used to host streaming content, such as a youtube video, by directly linking the embed source, you can test this with the NASA ISS stream:

### homarr-iframes from Diogo Valentim
The project [homarr-iframes](https://github.com/diogovalentte/homarr-iframes) has iframes designed to be used with Homarr, these iframes offer a minimalist view of other systems:

- [Vikunja](https://github.com/go-vikunja/vikunja): overview of your tasks with links to them.
- [Linkwarden](https://github.com/linkwarden/linkwarden): overview of your bookmarks with links to them.
- [Cinemark Brazil](https://www.cinemark.com.br): overview of the movies in Cinemark theaters in your city (*only in Brazil*).

![Image of the Vikunja (left), Linkwarden (middle), and Cinemark Brazil (right) iframes on a Homarr dashboard](./homarr-iframes-example.webp "Image of the Vikunja (left), Linkwarden (middle), and Cinemark Brazil (right) iframes on a Homarr dashboard")

You can [configure the iframes appearance and behavior](https://github.com/diogovalentte/homarr-iframes?tab=readme-ov-file#adding-to-homarr) using query arguments when adding them to your dashboard, like selecting the iframe theme and limit of items to show, and other options specific to each iframe.
